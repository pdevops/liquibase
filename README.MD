**Welcome to my Liquibase Tutorial**  
Here is a complete GitHub repository for my tutorial on automating your database schema changes with Liquibase. To know what to do with all these files, check out the detailed instructions and manual in the [Liquibase tutorial](https://pretius.com/liquibase-tutorial/)  itself.

**How to quickly find the example files which I need?**

As the tutorial is pretty huge (and new articles are upcoming) it may be difficult to find the example files you need at the moment. So, to make things as simple as possible, I created dedicated Git branches. The branches are named and ordered like the successive parts of the tutorial. You read further – you go to the next branch. Simple as that.

As for now, you’ve got these branches to choose from:  

 - 1_What_is_liquibase_and_how_to_start_using_it (installing Liquibase, 
   configuring it, and trying it out with a new database).    - 
 - 2_Start_using_liquibase_with_existing_project (using Liquibase with  
   your existing project)
