## Welcome to my Liquibase Tutorial.

You will find detailed instructions and manual at [Liquibase tutorial](https://pretius.com/liquibase-tutorial/)

## How to get example files through reading my manuals?

Just switch to dedicated Git branch - branches are called and ordered like articles.
The  further you read, then you go to next branch etc.

e.g. If you just started with Liquibase and reading article number 1 ->  switch to dedicated GIT branch "1_What_is_liquibase_and_how_to_start_using_it".
You will find files needed for article 1.
